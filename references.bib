abstract = {This paper describes a hidden Markov model-based approach designed to recognize off-line unconstrained handwritten words for large vocabularies. After preprocessing, a word image is segmented into letters or pseudoletters and represented by two feature sequences of equal length, each consisting of an alternating sequence of shape-symbols and segmentation-symbols, which are both explicitly modeled. The word model is made up of the concatenation of appropriate letter models consisting of elementary HMMs and an HMM-based interpolation technique is used to optimally combine the two feature sets. Two rejection mechanisms are considered depending on whether or not the word image is guaranteed to belong to the lexicon. Experiments carried out on real-life data show that the proposed approach can be successfully used for handwritten word recognition.},

At present, although the developmental trend in AI and its applications has surpassed expectations, an insurmountable gap remains between AI and human intelligence. It is urgent to establish a bridge between brain science and AI research, including a link from brain science to AI, and a connection from knowing the brain to simulating the brain. The first steps toward this goal are to explore the secrets of brain science by studying new brain-imaging technology; to establish a dynamic connection diagram of the brain; and to integrate neuroscience experiments with theory, models, and statistics. Based on these steps, a new generation of AI theory and methods can be studied, and a subversive model and working mode from machine perception and learning to machine thinking and decision-making can be established. This article discusses the opportunities and challenges of adapting brain science to AI."

    abstract = { We introduce a new approach for on-line recognition of handwritten words written in unconstrained mixed style. The preprocessor performs a word-level normalization by fitting a model of the word structure using the EM algorithm. Words are then coded into low resolution "annotated images" where each pixel contains information about trajectory direction and curvature. The recognizer is a convolution network that can be spatially replicated. From the network output, a hidden Markov model produces word scores. The entire system is globally trained to minimize word-level errors. }

This avoids the heavy experimental effort required to find the optimal configuration of a parameter set. A comparison between the new deslanting technique and the method proposed by Bozinovic and Srihari was made by measuring the performance of both methods within a word recognition system tested on different databases. The proposed technique is shown to improve the recognition rate by 10.8\% relative to traditional normalization methods. Moreover, a long exploration of the parameter space is avoided."

Segmentation used for text-based images aim in retrieval of specific information from the entire image. This information can be a line or a word or even a character. This paper proposes various methodologies to segment a text based image at various levels of segmentation. This material serves as a guide and update for readers working on the text based segmentation area of Computer Vision. First, the need for segmentation is justified in the context of text based information retrieval. Then, the various factors affecting the segmentation process are discussed. Followed by the levels of text segmentation are explored. Finally, the available techniques with their superiorities and weaknesses are reviewed, along with directions for quick referral are suggested. Special attention is given to the handwriting recognition since this area requires more advanced techniques for efficient information extraction and to reach the ultimate goal of machine simulation of human reading."

abstract = {Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data. In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},
